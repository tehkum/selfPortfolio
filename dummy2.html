    <h2 style="text-align:center">My college life</h2>
    <div id="overview">My college life is the best part of my life because I gained so many beautiful memories and so
        many friends who will be connected to me my whole life. I studied in Jecrc university which had a good
        infrastructure and good hostels too. But remember, we are bachelors and we are made to annoy the wardens.
        Everything in my college is good except studies and food. Talking about food, I used to eat only one time of
        meal in mess or sometime outside like kachori, samosa and all. Our college is built in a village like are far
        from city and facilities like every private universities. So, outside of our college was nothing far far away,
        only thing to stay alive was kachori and samosa. I can proudly say that my body evolved in this years i.e. I get
        hungry ones a day.

        <h3>The Saviour of life </h3>
        Every morning, an angel sent by the god comes outside our college as a poha wala bhaiya. He make such a nice
        poha that it was the saviour of lives of every college students. Seeing the food quality of mess, no one went
        there but everyone meet at pohawala's stall at morning daily to have poha. When I was in first year the plate of
        oh poha costed 20rs but now it costs 40rs. Such a deadly change of amount. Everyone knew that the pohawala
        bhaiya earned much more than a engineer because he always came there to sell poha wearing Zara shirts, gucci
        belts and titan watch and that were original. Many of my college mates decided to open a poha stall after seeing
        him.<bold>It gave me a spark that any field I work in, I should work that great that people want to become like
            me</bold>

        <h3>Hostel Time</h3>
        Guess what!! the best part of college life of a student is hostel life. In hostel a "sidha-sadha" student
        becomes harami and yes ofcourse many funny memories with hostel gang. I want to share one, Whenever the powercut
        in the hostel occurs, each and every animal reciding in a student comes out and every students gather in the
        corridors of the hostel and shouting slang slogans for warden. I was also a part of this and shouting the
        slogan, suddenly power came back and warden was standing behind me and he was very angry. I was afraid because I
        was caught red handed by the warden. Warden took me to his office and shouted at me first and then called my
        parents. I said sorry and closed that matter. Next day nothing changed, whenever powercut occures, I speak slang
        slogans but, now with precautions.
